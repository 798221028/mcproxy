Introduction
------------
Mcproxy is an IGMP/MLD Proxy daemon for Linux.

IGMP/MLD proxies offer the possibility option to combine local 
multicast networks with a larger multicast infrastructure. In contrast 
to multicast routers, proxies are lightweight and do not require the 
support of a multicast routing protocols such as PIM or DVMRP. A 
common use case are local stub networks that interconnect with a 
remote multicast routing domain, possible via a tunnel. Another usage 
example is in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6 - RFC 5213) domains that 
want to provide transparent multicast services for mobile nodes. The 
mcproxy meets the requirements of the IGMP/MLD proxy standard 
(RFC 4605) and has additional functionalities. The multicast proxy can 
be instantiated multiple times and is dynamically configurable at 
runtime.

        - ipv6 General Queries / Group Specific Queries send to all 
              downstreams
        - clean the kernel calls
        - ignore additional ipv4 addresses for one interfaces returned 
              by getifaddrs()

 * Version 0.1.1
    - Beta version
    - New Features:
        - fully documented by Doxygen

Requirements
------------
* To generate a makefile qmake, must be installed. This can be done with
the following command:
  
  apt-get install qt4-qmake

* To build the mcproxy, the libraries boost_threat, boost_date_time and 
boost_system must be installed. This can be done with the following 
command:
  
  apt-get install libboost-all-dev

* To use the IPv6 functionality the kernel has to be configured and 
compiled with the experimental kernel feature <IPv6: multicast routing>.
For more Details go to the projekt page.

* To use more then one proxy instance for IPv4 and IPv6 the kernel has
to  be configured and compiled with the experimental kernel feature
<IP: multicast policy routing> and <IPv6: multicast policy routing>. 
For more Details go to the pojekt page.

* To build the documentation, doxygen must be installed. This can be
done with the folling command:

  apt-get install doxygen

* The mcproxy has to be started with root privileges.

* A Linux kernel version greater than version 2.6.32 is required.

Compilation
-----------

Installation
------------
To copy mcproxy to system directories, run (optional):

  make install


Documentation
-----------------
Mcproxy includes a HTML documentation. The documentation will 
be located in the docs/ directory after the execution of:

    make doc

Directories
-----------
