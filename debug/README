Introduction
==================
Here you find a few tools to debug and test the mcproxy.


Dummy interface
==================
An easy way to test the mcproxy without physical hardware is 
to create dummy network interfaces.

Usage
-----
create 12 dummy interfaces

    sudo dummy_interfaces/auto_dummy.sh create 12

delete all dummy interface

    sudo dummy_interfaces/auto_dummy.sh delete


Kernel
==================
If you miss a kernel module you have to build your own kernel.
The script ./kernel/install_kernel-sh download, configure, 
compile and install one for you.

Usage
-----
see ./kernel/install_kernel-sh help
